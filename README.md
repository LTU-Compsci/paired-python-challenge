# Paired Python Challenge

This repository contains code artefacts for a paired python challenge.

+ Decide in your pair who will be Person A and who will be Person B
+ Person A should refer only to the clues in the person\_a folder
+ Person B should refer only to the clues in the person\_b folder

**Try to avoid looking at your partner's clues!** Instead, talk to each other and screenshare to solve the mysteries.
