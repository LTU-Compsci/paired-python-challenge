# Paired Python Challenge

This repository contains code artefacts for a paired python challenge.

+ Decide in your pair who will be Person A and who will be Person B
+ Person A should refer to the clues in the person\_a folder
+ Person B should refer to the clues in the person\_b folder

**Work together to solve the mysteries.** Try to avoid looking directly at your partner's clues, but instead communicate with each other over email and/or web chat.
